# Hotel_booking_analysis__EDA


I am very glad to make this project , this project help me to build up my coding skills and making my concept crystal clear.

I am very thankful to ALMABETTER to give such a beautiful projects. In all of those prjects i choosed HOTEL BOOKING ANALYSIS because i go through all the columns & statements of the questions they asked in that, it attracted me very much to attempt this project.

Let me summarise my project in few lines.

In this project's description there are two Hotels which are CITY HOTEL & RESORT HOTEL. According to the dataset there are 119390 rows & 32 columns.
In this project i have done 3 types of Data manipulation - Data collections,Data cleaning and the last one is EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis).

In Data collection:: I have found various columns with help of coding which are head(),tail(),describe(),info(),row(),column(). Some of the methods used & some column to be updated and changed here. Some columns has deleted due to duplicate column present in the list & many more things happened, you can easily go through my project.

In Data cleaning:: I have deleted some rows due to various duplicates value in the Dataset i.e there were 119390 rows after using drop_duplicates meethod as we find duplicates items equal to 87396.

Before visualizing any data from the Dataset we have done data Wrangling here.
With the help of this we checked the null value of all the columns.After getting most null value in the columns, i dropped that columns by using "drop method".When we find minimal number of null values, filling those null values with necessary value as per as requirement by using .fillna()

Data visualization:: According to the data visualization we found the relationshionship between the variables. Here we describe all the columns with differnt pie_chart plot.we plot the histogram , plot the chart for canceled & not_canceld hotel, one chart for showing weeek wise stay at the hotel, one use for month wise bookings, i show the market_segment through the chart visiual.
With the help of bar plot i show the revenue of hotel,i use scatter plot for showing total stay in night, after that i show the coorelation heatmap & at last i use pair plot using seaborn for showing the children in different types of columns.

This is the best ways to explain between two variables.

This is the summary of my project, i wish you like it most.
